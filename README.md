# PowerBI_sql

In this project, I calculate KPI's for a Pizza chain and present insights in interactive dashboard.

I calculate the KPI's , creating a database in Microsoft SQL Server and running SQL queries.

I then connect to the database using Power BI, calculate necessary measures with DAX.

Finally, I present the results using interactive dashboard.
